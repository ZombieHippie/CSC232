# Simple Board Game

In this assignment we were required to track two players progress on a game board.
Each player should roll a dice to move 1-6 spaces forward, and if they land on the
other's space, then that player they land on moves backwards 1-3 spaces. A player
wins by getting to the 20th space first.

Also print out when someone moves and when someone gets knocked back.

I asked a couple questions on stackoverflow when doing this:
 1. [How to set an object property to a previously initialized Array in C++](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28179744/how-to-set-an-object-property-to-a-previously-initialized-array-in-c)
 2. [The properties of my mutable class aren't being changed when accessed from vector. (Debugging)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28185127/the-properties-of-my-mutable-class-arent-being-changed-when-accessed-from-vecto)
